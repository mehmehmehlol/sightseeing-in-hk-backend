Sightseeing in Hong Kong 
========

## Objectives

This project provides a one-stop service for users to browse all the popular and local places in Hong Kong. User can also create an account for a more customizable experience.

## Motivation

I created a >40pages Google Doc for a friend who was planning a trip to Hong Kong. As much as I like to write all the places I recommend, now I have the web development skill, I wanted to transform that Google Doc to a user-friendly and simplistic-looking website for users to browse all the recommended place within minutes.

## Setup
